Introduction to computers

Our goal is to teach you how to take a real world problem and abstract it in a way that it can be solved with a computer.

1. To reach our goal we will;
   a. write small or medium sized programs in python
   b. Switch to real world problems and solve them with our python PROGRAMS
2. So what is a PROGRAM? A program is sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a COMPUTATION
3. What is computation? To understand computation we should understand type of knowledge. 
There are declarative and imperative knowledge. Imperative knowledge is like a RECIPE which tels us how to 
solve a problem.
5. The RECIPE like form or imperative knowledge is also name ALGORITHM. 
Algorithm is a description of how to perform a computation.
6. If we have an algorithm, how do we capture the idea of recipe(algorithm) in MECHANICAL PROCESS
7. First FIXED PROGRAM COMPUTERS are used to solve them. Each problem has a different speciall purpose computer. 
It is like having a computer for excel, another for word, and another for twitter. It is not practical. 
STORED PROGRAM COMPUTER which we use today was a solution
8. Stored program computer has an instruction set. Given small set of instructions we can then build any kind of programs we want.
